**Billing Service **

**Scenario**

Cafe X menu consists of the following items:

- Cola - Cold – 50 cents
- Coffee - Hot - $1.00
- Cheese Sandwich - Cold - $2.00
- Steak Sandwich - Hot - $4.50

Customers don&#39;t know how much to tip and staff need tips to survive!

This project generates a bill including a service charge, so customers don&#39;t have to work out how much to tip.

**Constraints:**

1. Pass in a list of purchased items that produces a total bill
2. When all purchased items are drinks no service, charge is applied
3. When purchased items include any food apply a service charge of 10% to the total bill (rounded to 2 decimal places)
